        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Latch Kostov, a Full-Stack Developer with a passion for
          creating responsive and high-performance applications. With a keen
          understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, I have
          honed my skills working with technologies like React and C# to deliver
          effective solutions to complex problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the modern age of web development, where the user experience is
          paramount, I believe that a truly great application must not only work
          well on all devices but also be efficient and responsive. This is why
          I always prioritize responsive design principles when crafting my
          applications, ensuring that they provide a seamless experience whether
          viewed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, I recognize that performance is crucial. Users demand
          fast, fluid applications, and delivering on this demand can be the
          difference between success and failure. That's why I consider
          performance from the very beginning of the development process, and
          continually monitor and optimize it throughout. I take pride in
          writing clean, efficient code that runs smoothly and quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal as a developer is not just to write code, but to create
          software that makes a difference. I'm constantly learning, growing,
          and pushing myself to be better. I look forward to bringing my
          commitment to quality, performance, and user experience to your
          projects.
